# Krak Support Bot

Krak support is a modmail bot. Modmail bots receive Direct Message and then they push them to a private channel that moderators can see them. 
To reply to one of them, you can either send a dm with the bot or send a dm with your account!

For privacy reasons, we created a slash command called `ticket_reply` and there the moderator can reply through the bot! 
For this to work, we have added an ID generator for every dm that the bot receives! In the slash command the only argument that is require is the `ticket_id`. There the moderator needs to fill in with the an available ID. Then, it will appear a window where the moderator needs to fill in the box with the reply of the message! 

That's how Krak Support Bot works! You can do anything with it and we hope we help you!
